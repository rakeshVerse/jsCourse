## Object oriented programming in JS

Four pillars of Oops:

- Encapsulation: private variables & methods
- Abstraction: Hide unessasary details
- Inheritance: Inherite similar functionality to avoid redundancy
- Polymorphism: Function overriding. Child class can override parent class methods

### JavaScript doesn't have classes in the sense of traditional Oop

In JS, we have Prototypes that has methods & properties. An object gets access to all the methods & properties of the Prototype it is linked to.

In other words, Object delegates its work to its Prototype. This is known as `Prototypal Inheritance` or `Object Delegation`.

```js
const num = [23, 2, 45, 6];
num.map();
num.forEach();
```

Here, `num` is an object of Array Prototype. `num` has access to all the methods of Array.Prototype like forEach, map, etc.

### There are three ways of simulating Object oriented paradigm in JS

`I. Constructor Function`: Classical way of simulating classes

`II. ES6 Classes:` Syntatic sugar. Behind the scenes it creates Contructor Function

`III. Object.create():` Simple but less used way
